# Hi, I am Samuel ðŸ‘‹

![welcome](./welcome.png)

I am a Roblox developer and a Discord bot developer. You might know me through Megaphone bot or Moblox. If you want to manage your Roblox group easier I suggets you reading the instructions of Moblox. Well anyways, I am always up to conversations about my projects or questions.
